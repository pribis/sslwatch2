* SSLWatch2 *


This program was created almost exclusively using Gemini.
I wanted to test the results of using AI to program
a utility.

I was able to create this small tool in a couple of hours
and I was fairly impressed. I did some major refactoring
and Gemini got things right on the first try.

I still need to go through the code, but what I saw
was pretty good. In real life I wouldn't use
Gemini (or any other) to code an entire project,
but I would definitely use it to aid the development.

The GUI is entirly Gemini. I prefer working directly
from the commandline and so, I don't use tools with
GUI's very often. In otherwords, I don't do GUI's.
But with this program I took the middle road and
used curses. I'm pretty much incompetent which it
comes to GUI's, so I let Gemini create the whole 
thing.

In the end. you have a small (under 300 lines) utility
to check the ssl cert status of a website.

You can even create a file of domains (one per line)
and tell sslwatch2 to read it and process it.
